###LabelMaker3000
######Programmer: John Costanzo

This program will prompt the user to enter a Start location and an End location (for our
warehouse) and will then print all the locations in between in a file "labels.txt" on the user's
Desktop. It will create a GUI with text fields and radio buttons. The radio buttons will 
alter the printed label pattern. The "Every 2" and "Every 4" buttons will skip over every 2 or
4 locations, as that may be the label pattern in the warehouse. The "Totem Poles" button will 
print the labels horizontally rather than vertically, breaking at a change of section. The text
file should be imported into an Excel spreadsheet, then BarTender can print the labels 
individually, or the Totem Pole spreadsheet can be sent to our "Totem Pole provider" (?) to make
Totem Poles for us.
